Help to guide, using websocket both laravel with reactjs and react and also C#.
This language we use to create an web application and desktop application.
Now, in C# is the one I use to make an Fingerprint Biometrics, for desktop application.
And React, Inertia and Laravel for Web Application.
So, I use both for my projects which the capstone, named HRIS is a Biometrics Attendance Management System.
The happened is C# is the for fingerprint application, and React with Laravel is for Web DEv.
So, create on how to do it, make a flow and pseudocode for my idea.
I like to fingerprint data will pass to react and laravel.
Using node.js and websocket as a bridge.
C# will passing a fingerprint data and image to react and laravel, react will display an image of fingerprint from C#.
And laravel the one to save the fingerprint data to database.
And make also, that the data will use for verification and matching when use in attendance.
Create a guide and pseudocode, so I can easily paste your guide and understand.





 Fingerprint Registration Flow
User places a finger on the fingerprint scanner (C# desktop app).

C# application captures the fingerprint image and generates a fingerprint template string.

C# converts the fingerprint image to base64 string.

C# opens a WebSocket connection to the Node.js WebSocket server (ws://localhost:8080).

C# sends a JSON payload through WebSocket containing:

employee_id

image_base64

template_data

captured_at timestamp

Node.js WebSocket server receives the JSON from C# and broadcasts it to all connected React (Inertia) clients via WebSocket.

React (Inertia) app listens to the WebSocket, receives the JSON, and displays the image and employee info immediately on the UI.

React (Inertia) app uses axios.post() to send the received fingerprint data to a Laravel API route (/api/fingerprint/store).

Laravel API receives the POST request and saves the fingerprint data (template, employee_id, timestamp) to the database.

Laravel responds with a success message.

React (Inertia) displays a confirmation message on the UI.

ðŸ“Œ Fingerprint Attendance Verification Flow
User places a finger on the fingerprint scanner via C# desktop app.

C# captures the fingerprint image and generates a template string.

C# converts the image to base64 and sends a JSON payload via WebSocket to the Node.js server.

Node.js WebSocket server receives the data.

Node.js forwards the JSON via axios.post() (from server-side Node.js) to Laravel API endpoint (/api/fingerprint/verify).

Laravel API compares the received template against stored templates in the database.

If a match is found:

Laravel records an attendance log for the employee

Laravel sends a JSON response with match result and employee details

Node.js receives the verification result from Laravel.

Node.js broadcasts the verification result via WebSocket to all connected React (Inertia) clients.

React (Inertia) receives the result and updates the UI with attendance status (Success / Not Found / Error).

ðŸ“œ Pseudocode in Sentences (with Inertia + Axios)
ðŸ“¦ C#
Capture fingerprint data and image

Convert image to base64

Connect to WebSocket server

Send JSON with employee_id, image_base64, template_data, captured_at

ðŸ“¦ Node.js WebSocket Server
On message from C#:

Broadcast JSON to React (Inertia) via WebSocket

Send JSON via axios.post() to Laravel API endpoint

ðŸ“¦ React (Inertia)
Connect to WebSocket server

On receiving fingerprint data:

Display fingerprint image (base64) and employee info on the frontend

Use axios.post() to send data to Laravel API /api/fingerprint/store

On receiving attendance result:

Show status (Success / Failure) notification on UI

ðŸ“¦ Laravel API
On /api/fingerprint/store POST request:

Save fingerprint data into database

Return success response

On /api/fingerprint/verify POST request:

Compare template against stored templates

Return result (matched / not matched / error)

C# (capture) â†’ WebSocket â†’ Node.js (broadcast + axios to Laravel) â†’ React (Inertia) (display + axios) â†’ Laravel (store/verify)
